## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing key performance indicators within the hospitality domain using real-world data. The goal is to empower hotel managers and revenue teams with insights to optimize pricing, manage occupancy, and improve overall performance. The interactive Power BI dashboard covers a range of metricsâ€”from revenue by category to trends in occupancy and average daily rates (ADR).

## Data Description

The project utilizes the following CSV files:

- **dim_dates**: Contains detailed date information to support time-based analysis.
- **dim_hotels**: Includes hotel-related information such as hotel IDs, names, and locations.
- **dim_rooms**: Provides details about different room types and capacities.
- **fact_aggregated_bookings**: Offers aggregated booking data for revenue, occupancy, and related performance metrics.
- **fact_bookings**: Contains transactional booking details for granular analysis.

All these datasets have been integrated in Power BI to calculate and visualize important hospitality metrics.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation & Integration**  
   - **Cleaning & Merging:** Data from different CSV files was cleansed (handling missing values and duplicates) and joined using common keys (e.g., hotel_id, date).
   - **Aggregation:** Booking and revenue data were aggregated at various dimensions (by date, hotel, room type) to calculate key performance indicators.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Conducted initial EDA to understand trends and spot anomalies in the booking data.
   - Identified key metrics such as revenue, RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), and occupancy percentages.

3. **Dashboard Development in Power BI**  
   - **Calculated Measures:** Custom DAX measures were created for metrics like % Revenue by Category, Realisation %, and ADR by booking platform.
   - **Interactive Visuals:** Multiple visuals (bar charts, line charts, and trend graphs) were designed to show weekly performance, day type analysis (weekday vs. weekend), and platform-based performance.
   - **Slicers & Filters:** Interactive filters (e.g., by City and Room Type) allow users to drill down into specific segments.
